<p style="font-size:40px"><u>HOME VISIT:</u><br></p>
<p style="font-size:25px"><img src="10.jpg" alt="10" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">We are all about servicing pets within the comfort of their own home! We want them to be most comfortable while you are away. 
What you'll need to do is tell us how many visits you would like your fur-family to have each day and what times will work best with their daily routine so we can schedule accordingly. 
We happily provide picture/text/email updates as many times as you want while away to help ensure you have that peace of mind!<br></p>
<p style="font-size:40px"><u>DOG WALKING:</u><BR></p>
<p style="font-size:25px"><img src="12.jpg" alt="Pineapple" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">We all know dogs get bored! And frankly, life keeps us really busy sometimes. We don't always have the time/energy we so desperately want and need to give to our beloved pets. 
This is why we are committed to helping them with their daily exercise/play to help sustain optimal health and quality of life for all of you! 
You let us know what days throughout the week you would like your fur-family to have a visit from us and we will gladly schedule accordingly!<br></p>
<p style="font-size:40px"><u>In-HOME CONSULTATION:</u><br></p>
<p style="font-size:25px"><img src="13.jpg" alt="Pineapple" style="width:170px;height:170px;margin-left:15px;">An initial in-home consultation is required in order to proceed with our services. Because of this, we offer a one time in-home consultation FREE of charge! This gives you and us the opportunity to discuss you and your pets needs. 
When planning for this appointment please keep in mind you will need to allow at the very least 30 minutes for this consultation. This will allow for a proper meet and greet with you and your fur family.
